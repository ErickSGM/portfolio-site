The company that holds the Brazilian national products database was suffering from service pirating, and they were performing better at Search Engines, making things worse. They were getting the data from open trial APIs, that, even though it limited the damage to a certain extent, was an open door from which someone could gradually steal the data. While we could not generate an optimized static page for every item in the database, since it was the company model of business, of selling products information, we ended creating a static page for each of the most tops searched products of each month. This way, even if we opened a little bit their database, it served the purpose of marketing. Eventually, we regained the first ranked searches for those high on demand products.
