We refactored and improved Previ's pension fund app, making it easier to maintain and to create new features to its ever-increasing scope. We came from a simple set of features to a full-ﬂedged app, which could provide not only reports about user pensions but make loans, declare income tax discounts, make previsions and realize investments. The biggest challenges were the multiple client APIs integrations, cache structure, inter-team communication, data analytics and serve thousands of simultaneous users. Achieving frequently the ﬁrst most downloaded economic app here in Brazil was very rewarding.
