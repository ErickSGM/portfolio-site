One of the jobs was to transform their git based SAAS system for a real white label system that would require little to none work to customize for each of their clients. To do this we implemented different javascript loading for each client and made a lot of customization points where we could specify what component would render on there, the props we would pass to the component or CSS we would apply on that page or component.
