We've had only two weeks to deliver a complex insurance flow for an insurance app licitation. It needed to have insurance simulation and contract, user data collecting, digital signature, and some product and packaging logics. We developed it using Angular 6, with local cache, autosave and token validation for signature. We also made it responsive and kept clean code all the time and tests for most features. In the end, we got appraised for managing to pull that out in two weeks with only a team of three.
