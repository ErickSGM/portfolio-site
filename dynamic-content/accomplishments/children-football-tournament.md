Participated in the process of creation and prototyping of an Ionic 1 and AngularJS app for the most prominent children football championship in Latin America. The app had to show the tournament and matches that were occurring and their results, as well as information about the players, teams, help information, and third-party services at the site. It was available both for IOS and Android.
