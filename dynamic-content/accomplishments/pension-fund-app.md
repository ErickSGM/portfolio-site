Refactored and improved a public company pension fund app, made in Ionic 3 and Angular 6, making it easier to maintain and to create new features to its ever-increasing scope. We came from a simple set of features to a full-fledged app, which could provide not only reports about user pensions but make loans, declare income tax discounts, make previsions and realize investments. We had to deal with multiple client APIs integrations, cache structure, inter-team communication, data analytics and serve thousands of simultaneous users. Also, we had to make everything clear, because we managed users investments, loans, retirement simulation, and other money features. Achieving frequently the first most downloaded economic app here in Brazil was very rewarding. We are currently studying and bringing the use of Graphql to optimize the client calls and reduce the network data traffic and we moved it's CI/CD  to the cloud.
