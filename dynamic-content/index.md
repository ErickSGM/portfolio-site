I am Erick Garcia, a 27 years old Brazilian from Rio. A person who went from modding and creating simple things for games as a child, to loving backend and server, and still find space in my heart to build frontend stuff â€” an enthusiast for reactive programming, CQRS, distributed systems, and functional programming.

I have experience with most popular .Net technologies, having used .net core, akka.net, some f#, cqrs frameworks, entity framework, among others. It is one of my favorites languages, and I've worked professionally with it for four years now. Still, I have much experience with frontend frameworks and node, being a versatile full-stack and enjoying doing so.

Talking about frontend, I hold three years of experience with React, and it's complex ecosystem: redux, saga, storybook, jest, babel, to list a few. I also have a few years in with experience with Angular, Ionic and Node, having done some important projects with them.

Even have been working professionally as a programmer for six years now, I still consider communication and team interaction having the same weight as experience. Discussing ideas and solutions with the team, always make them more robust and improve the product as a whole, no matter how much experience people in this team have. I always try to have a grasp of the overall product and help developing it, not just finish one more task or issue from a technical standpoint. Also interacting fast, having a friendly environment and actual friends, and not just colleagues at work are values I also appreciate a lot. Those are some of the reasons I stayed at Working Minds for so long and one of the reasons I'm looking forward to on Conference Compass. Also, I always treat the company I'm currently working as "We", not just "it".
